- Data
  - Download dog images
	- ImageNet http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/
  - Download and curate korean food images
	- Go through each photo and remove irrelevant ones

- Try
  - Transfer learning
	- using deep features
	- retraining from beginning if possible
  - Modify inception v3 classify_image.py to extract deep features, and run it on all image datasets
  - use dato, caffe pretrained networks, metamind API
  - Upload same train-test set to metamind and test how it does using api - write up comparison

- Tech stack
  - cassandra/lucene
  - angular2.0?
  - android/ios apps
  - web server
	- django
	- golang

- Possible applications:
  - Korean food recommender system using deep features
  - Lost dogs, children, stolen cars
  - Use deep features as embedding, like wordvec (find source pdf to cite)
	- filtering images in feeds, i.e. instagram
	- reverse - let users know that their image is not that special
	- pca to reduce features (find meaning of each attribute from papers) - didn't work
	  - second row: puppy, clothes, person in the picture, which are more interesting than first row (image_processing.ipynb)
	  - PCA with marginal features (http://imagine.enpc.fr/~aubrym/projects/features_analysis/texts/understanding_deep_features_with_CG.pdf)
		- various colors
		- square sizes
		- different cropped shapes of same image

- Report: write arxive-type paper in markdown
  - formulate/motivate the problem
  - optimize computing - inception modules same goal (look at paper http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567v3.pdf)
  - similarity ranking - http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jwa368/pdfs/deep_ranking.pdf
	- how to measure?
	- check that deep feature embedding distances is monotonic with respect to "likeness" - proof?
		- show cluster of tSNE
		- show avg distance from each other vs other labels
